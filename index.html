<h1>PWA (Progressive Web Application)</h1>
<p>PWAs are used for several reasons, but a few characteristics make them better than alternatives. Firstly it’s reliable, meaning that a PWA will always load quickly whenever launched, while other sites may not. By using Service Workers, PWAs eliminate their dependence on the network and internet, making it so that users can always load their content quickly no matter where they are.</p>
<p>This means that PWAs are fast, which is another reason why they are appealing. No one wants to use a slow website, and many become frustrated when dealing with a slow or unresponsive site. PWAs eliminate that and make the experience more enjoyable for users. Lastly, PWAs are engaging. This is seen through the ability to download a PWA on the user’s home screen without an app store. Web manifest files can also be used to customize the app to better appeal to app users, which creates another level of engagement.</p>
