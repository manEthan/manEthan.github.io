		<p>My name is Ethan Man, and I'm currently a Junior at Carlmont High School. This is my second time taking a course at this college, and it's my first time doing so while school is in place. Some hobbies I have are video games, watching sports, or playing golf. I also like hanging out with my dog(who you can see on the left).</p>

	<p>I am attending this class because coding and understanding how applications work is an essential skill that may open more doors for me to study and pursue later in life. I've taken some computer science courses before, and this would be one step further into a more specific facet of that. We've also learned firsthand this year how important applications and technology are for everyday life. By learning this skill, I can potentially help develop a field that is becoming more and more vital to everyday life.</p>

	<h2>Technologies for this class</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Resources</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">W3schools</a>
			<p style="display:inline"> - W3schools is a site that provides several quick and easy-to-follow lessons for if you ever need to learn how to do a specific task, like displaying links with HTML, for example. I find their suggestions to work well most of the time, and I would definitely recommend it as a useful resource.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a>
			<p style="display:inline"> - Stackoverflow is another excellent resource, with a great forum for people to help solve each other's problems. If you have an issue with your code, chances are someone else has experienced a similar difficulty and has had it fixed, and this is one website where you can find those answers.</p>
